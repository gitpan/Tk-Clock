Tk-Clock

DESCRIPTION
    A canvas clock widget with both analog and digital represen-
    tation of both time and date.

    It is highly configurable for as far as colors and fonts and
    the way time and date is displayed.

    The year is displayed in two digits  in the default configu-
    ration, which makes it not Y2K compliant.

PREREQUISITES
    perl5 (probably 5.004.04 or better)
    Tk (probably 400.xxx or better)

    I'm able to test it on perl version 5.005.03 with Tk 800.014
    and Tk 800.015,  but it doesn't use stange or undocumented
    features, so it will probably run on older Tk and/or perl
    versions.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
    As all CPAN modules:
	# perl Makefile.PL
	# make test
	# make install

    make test should run the clock with some changing contrasting
    colors showing the following configurations for 4 seconds each:
    	1. Both analog and digital clock,
    	2. Only analog clock,
    	3. Only digital clock,
    	4. Both analog- and digital clock using an american like
    	   time/date format (for wich I shouldn't actualy support
    	   formats, cause amaricans do often not support european
    	   formats, but I thought, I'd be nice for this time),
	5. Only digital clock with an empty time format and a
	   double line date format showing the day of the week
	   and the date.
