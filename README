This is a canvas clock widget with both analog and digital representation
of both time and date.

It is reasonable configurable for as far as colors and fonts and the way
time and date is displayed.

The year is displayed in two digits, which makes it not Y2K compliant.

The format of the date is fixed at DD-MM-YY, which should be
configurable in the future, though it's rather ease to modify
this behaviour.

make test should run the clock with some contrasting colors
for about ten seconds. The first 5 seconds with an european
time/date format, the next 5 seconds with an amarican like
time/date format (for wich I shouldn't actualy support formats,
cause amaricans do often not support european formats, but I
thought, I'd be nice for this time).
