This is a canvas clock widget with both analog and digital
representation of both time and date.

It is reasonable configurable for as far as colors and fonts
and the way time and date is displayed.

The year is displayed in two digits, which makes it not Y2K
compliant.

The format of the date is fixed at DD-MM-YY, which should be
configurable in the future, though it's rather ease to modify
this behaviour.

make test should run the clock with some contrasting colors
for about 20 seconds. The first 5 seconds with both analog-
and digital clock enabled, the next 5 secs only analog, than
5 secs only digital.  The last 5 seconds with both analog-
and digital clock enabled using an amarican like time/date
format (for wich I shouldn't actualy support formats, cause
amaricans do often not support european formats, but I thought,
I'd be nice for this time).
